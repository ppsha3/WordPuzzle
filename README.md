# WordPuzzle
A text based game in which you guess the word, letter by letter, in the defined number of attempts.

Note:

  The latest essential file is 'main.py'. You need following folders alongwith 'main.py' to run the game properly:
    1) words
    2) music

Current Version:

  The current version does not ask to set the number of attempts. It also does neither have a hint option nor a way to track your previous guesses.

Background:
Actually, to give you all a brief about the project. This is my second project in python which in my free time(after work). I had just started learning python and found this on searching online videos for beginner friendly projects. I first wrote the terminal game(without GUI) which has a bit more features(inlcuding hint and previous guesses). 

If you want to check out the terminal game, run 'hangman_1.py'.
